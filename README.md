#F(s)

Functional CSS library for rapid prototyping. These styles are based off of BassCSS and designed to
work well with most other css libraries, notably animate.css.

####Why functional CSS?

Functional CSS reasoning here.
 1. CSS filesize rarely grows, and never by much
 2. Functional styles don't interfere with each other
 3. Faster HTML prototyping
 4. Great for frontend component-pattern (like React)

####How to use

```npm install f-of-s```
